# Virtual Party Mom

## Description

The purpose of this application is to provide a virtual tool to use at group gatherings. This tool allows the user to check the weather, and then retrieve suggestions for group activities based on the current weather conditions. This application includes a joke generator, a Cards Against Humanity game, a Would You Rather? game, and a section with suggestions for outdoor activities. The motivation behind this project stemmed from our desire to be able to provide entertainment at group gatherings when ideas and/or physical game cards are lacking. Throughout the course of building this project, we learned how to effectively collaborate and work in separate GitHub branches. We learned how to resolve merge conflicts and handle other Git issues without breaking the codebase in our main branch. In the future, we plan to continually update this application as we learn more technical skills. One feature in particular that we would like to add is the ability to play Cards Against Humanity on one screen against the computer, rather than having each user play on their own device.
